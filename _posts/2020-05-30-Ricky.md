## Jekyll 安裝及啟動

Lanyon is an unassuming [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It's based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com), the Jekyll butler.

### MAC 安裝 Jekyll serve

安裝 Jekyll 前，須先確認是否已安裝 Ruby:

```
    ~$> ruby --version
    ruby 2.7.0p0 (2019-12-25 revision 647ee6f091) [x86_64-darwin17]

    ~$> gem install bundler jekyll
    ~$> jekyll new my-awesome-site
    ~$> cd my-awesome-site$> bundle install
    ~$> cd my-awesome-site$> bundle exec jekyll serve
    # => Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```


接著在網址列輸入 [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) 即可連上本機 Jekll Serve.

### 啟動本機 Jekyll serve [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/)

```$> bundle exec jekyll serve```

接著在網址列輸入 [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) 即可連上本機 Jekll Serve.

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404](/404), [RSS feed](/atom.xml), posts, and [example page](/about))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Lanyon features

In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:

* Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via **☰** link in top corner
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes), available via `<body>` classes

[Head to the readme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme) to learn more.

### Browser support

Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!
